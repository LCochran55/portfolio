# About Me!

Welcome! Iâ€™m Liam Cochran, a physics and computer science major currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at Willamette University. 
Through my high school and current college education, I have honed my skills in programmming and mathematics, as well as in tools such as Python, Java.
Outside of work, I enjoy creating art, curating music playlists, and catching up on TV shows.
